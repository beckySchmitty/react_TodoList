# Todo App with React

Create a Todo App that allows users to see, add, edit, and remove todos. It should contain the following components.

* App - this component should render the TodoList component
* TodoList - this component should render the NewTodoForm component and should render the list of Todo components. Place your state that contains all of the todos in this component.
* NewTodoForm - this component should render a form with one text input for the task to be created. When this form is submitted, a new Todo component should be created. 
* Todo- this component should display a div with the task of the todo.
For each Todo component, there should also be a button with the text “X” that when clicked, removes the todo.
